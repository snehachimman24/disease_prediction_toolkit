# Disease Prediction Toolkit

A machine learning toolkit for disease prediction.  
It provides preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization in a clean, reusable structure.

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handle missing values, scaling, splitting)
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Visualization (Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease_prediction_toolkit.git
cd disease_prediction_toolkit
pip install -r requirements.txt
from src.preprocessing import load_and_preprocess
from src.models import train_logistic
from src.evaluation import evaluate_model

# Load & preprocess
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = load_and_preprocess("diabetes.csv")

# Train
model = train_logistic(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
evaluate_model("Logistic Regression", y_test, y_pred, model, X_test)
